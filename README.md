#Reliable Data Transport Protocol

Overview

This project implements a reliable data transport protocol using the Go-Back-N (GBN) technique in a simulated environment. The simulation, written in C, is designed to emulate packet loss and packet corruption in order to thoroughly test the protocol's reliability and efficiency.

Features

Reliable data transport using Go-Back-N protocol
Packet loss and corruption simulation
Written in C for performance and low-level control
Detailed logging and statistics for analysis
Getting Started

Prerequisites
GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or any C99 compatible compiler
Git (to clone the repository)
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reliable-data-transport.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd reliable-data-transport
Compile the project:
bash
Copy code
gcc entity.c simulator.c -o myproject
Run the simulation:
bash
Copy code
./myproject 0.0 0.0 10 500 3 test1.txt
The generic command-line arguments are:

php
Copy code
$ ./myproject <loss prob> <corrupt prob> <pkt interval> <seed> <debug> <input file>
Configuration
You can configure the simulation parameters in the config.h file. This includes options such as packet loss rate, corruption rate, and the Go-Back-N window size.

Usage

Once the project is compiled and the simulation is running, you can analyze the logs and statistics generated by the program. This information provides insights into the efficiency and reliability of the Go-Back-N protocol under various network conditions.
