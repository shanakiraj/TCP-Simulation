# Reliable Data Transport Protocol

## Overview

This project implements a reliable data transport protocol using the Go-Back-N (GBN) technique in a simulated environment. The simulation, written in C, is designed to emulate packet loss and packet corruption in order to thoroughly test the protocol's reliability and efficiency.

## Features
* Reliable data transport using Go-Back-N protocol
* Packet loss and corruption simulation
* Written in C for performance and low-level control
* Detailed logging and statistics for analysis

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or any C99 compatible compiler
* Git (to clone the repository)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reliable-data-transport.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory:
`cd reliable-data-transport`
C3. Compile the project:
`gcc entity.c simulator.c -o myproject`
4. Run the simulation:
`./myproject 0.0 0.0 10 500 3 test1.txt`
The generic command-line arguments are:
`./myproject <loss prob> <corrupt prob> <pkt interval> <seed> <debug> <input file>`
### Configuration
You can configure the simulation parameters in the **config.h** file. This includes options such as packet loss rate, corruption rate, and the interval of time in which packets are sent.

### Usage

Once the project is compiled and the simulation is running, you can analyze the logs and statistics generated by the program. This information provides insights into the efficiency and reliability of the Go-Back-N protocol under various network conditions.
